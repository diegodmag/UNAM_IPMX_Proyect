[Análisis de operadores de recombinación del algoritmo genético aplicado al problema de las n-reinas](https://tesiunam.dgb.unam.mx/F/HHAD8YK5H37YSC97KJQ3MJA27C1EI7164T47ID2EJSLGJ8AYHI-08491?func=full-set-set&set_number=068622&set_entry=000001&format=999)

The objective of the project was to analyze four crossover operators that use permutation-based representation within a generic genetic algorithm. The analysis focused on both the computational execution time and the solution quality (fitness) achieved by the GA using each of the four operators. To achieve this, the methodology included a time complexity analysis of the Python implementation, followed by a comparison of the average results of each operator across thirty executions on different instance sizes. An important result was the conclusion that IPMX outperformed PMX, as well as my proposed implementation called PMX2, which showed competitive execution times.
